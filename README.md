# Character Recognition System
Implementing Adaptive Linear Model (Adaline) network with Python.

Implementing Adaptive Linear Model (Adaline) network to recognize patterns of some characters. 
The network will be trained using 2 pieces of data that represent the letters X and O.
After the learning process has succeeded in finding appropriate weight and bias values, then the testing process is carried out to find out characters stored in the test data.
Test data consists of two types, namely test data without noise(same data as training data) and test data with noise (data that are not exactly the same, but similar to training data).
Through the testing process, accuracy calculations will be carried out, namely the comparison of the number of test data that were successfully recognized correctly and the total number of test data.
