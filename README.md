# Character-Recognition
Implementing Adaptive Linear Model (Adaline) network with Python.

Implementing the Adaptive Linear Model (Adaline) network to recognize patterns of some characters. 
The network will be trained using 2 pieces of data that represent the letters X and O.
After the learning process has succeeded in finding appropriate weight and bias values, then the testing process is carried out to find out characters stored in the test data.
Test data consists of two types, namely test data without noise(same data as training data) and test data with noise (data that are not exactly the same, but similar to training data).
